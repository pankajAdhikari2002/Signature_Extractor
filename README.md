# Signature Extractor
What did i wanted to achieve?
->I wanted to convert a image with a signature to usable png file 
  with a transparent background, so that user can use the image as 
  he pleases.
->I also wanted to add a feature where, user can change the 
  signature color/Background color to his wishes.

I faced many shortcoming, due to my lack of image manipulation
expertise.

Please help me complete this project!

U can grasp the current scenario of my code my going to the
"**images**" where the input image is stored and the
"**output**" where the output image is stored.

Note: While viewing the output image please download and view!
